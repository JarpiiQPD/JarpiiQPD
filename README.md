- 👋 Hi, I’m @JarpiiQPD
- 👀 I’m interested in C, C# and Python. 
- 🌱 I am actively teaching myself off of videos from the internet to code in different languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that anyone is willing to colab with me, I mostly need it for the experience and functionality.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord will be your best bet I would say.. JarpiiQPD#3814
